The disclosure details the implementation of APPARATUSES, METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR PORTABLE UNIVERSAL PROFILE. The disclosure teaches a PUP, which provides interactive, responsive and efficient portable universal profile for creating universal portable IDs for individuals, entities, and/or systems. In one embodiment, the PUP allows people to package web links to the information of interest to them in a responsive tag or PUP-interface. For example, a user may create a personal widget comprised of links to the content, events and products they want to promote and share. In one embodiment, this personal widget may be an easy-to-use application for online self-publishing and self-distribution, complete with available user metrics. In a further embodiment, the PUP may let a user know every time a friend looks at their widget or clicks a link. In this way, users can get a better understanding of common interests and get feedback from friends on what they may be most interested in. The personal widget may be portable and posted ubiquitously across the Web, and/or it may be posted within particular technical environments taking advantage of particular functionality available in those environments (such as social networking sites like Facebook.com, MySpace.com, LinkedIn.com, etc.). In some embodiments, a PUP-I interacts with the environment in which it is posted/hosted or published. In some such embodiments, the PUP-I may be configured to obtain and/or supply data associated with the user, updating and reconciling information between and among various environments (e.g., coordinating a user's MySpace profile with their Facebook profile).
